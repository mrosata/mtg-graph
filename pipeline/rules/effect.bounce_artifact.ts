// 2026-06-02 audit Wave 2 — the prior PATTERN_BLINK_OWN arm has been removed
// from this rule. It matched "exile <artifact> ... return ... to the
// battlefield" frames which are blink (immediate) or flicker (delayed
// end-step), NOT bounce-to-hand. Those cases are now owned by
// `effect.blink` and `effect.flicker`. This rule's surviving arms ALL
// anchor the destination as "hand". Mirrors the narrowing already applied
// to effect.bounce_creature.

// 2026-06-01 audit batch — Ishgard, the Holy See: add `from … graveyard`
// negative lookahead. "Return up to two target artifact and/or enchantment
// cards from your graveyard to your hand" is graveyard recursion (owned by
// effect.return_from_graveyard_to_hand), not battlefield bounce. The
// existing `(?!\s+card)` lookahead didn't catch it because the noun was
// "artifact and/or enchantment cards" with intervening "and/or enchantment"
// tokens between "artifact" and "cards".
// v0.35.0 — Batch 20: admit `(?:other\s+)?` after the "up to <count>"
// quantifier so "up to one other target artifact ..." (Metalhead, Nobody)
// reaches the artifact noun. Metalhead's "return up to one other target
// artifact or creature to its owner's hand" — the artifact branch of the
// disjunction fires bounce_artifact (alongside bounce_creature on the
// other branch). Nobody's "return up to one other target artifact you
// control to its owner's hand" is the self-controlled artifact bounce
// shape.
