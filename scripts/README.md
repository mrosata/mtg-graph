# MTG Arena Collection Exporter

This tool scans your game memory while MTG Arena is running to export your entire card collection.
It outputs two files:
- `mtga_collection.json`: Full data including card IDs and quantities.
- `mtga_collection.txt`: A readable list of your cards (Count + Name).

## How to use

### Option 1: Run the Executable (Simplest)
1. Navigate to **Releases**
2. Download and extract the **zip**
4. Navigate inside the extradted folder
5. Ensure **MTG Arena is running**.
6. Go to the **Decks** or **Collection** tab in-game, scroll for 30 secs through your collection (important so your collection loads into memory).
7. Run `MTGA_Exporter.exe`.
8. Follow the prompts to allow the tool do find and export your collection.

### Option 2: Run from Python Source
1. Download and extract zip
3. navigate inside folder
4. Install Python 3.x.
5. Run `install.bat` to install dependencies (`pymem`, `requests`).
6. Run `python mtg.py`.

## Troubleshooting
- If the tool cannot find your collection, ensure you have visited the Collection/Decks tab.
- Try providing different anchor cards if the first attempt fails (rarer anchor cards such as [O:legendary] work better, as they are more unique to your collection).
- Run as Administrator if you encounter permission errors.

## macOS / cross-platform

The bundled exporter under `scripts/mtga_export/` also runs on macOS:

1. Double-click `launch-mac.command`.
2. Approve the macOS password prompt — reading Arena's memory needs admin.
3. Open MTG Arena and visit the **Collection** tab; scroll through it so your collection loads into memory.
4. Back in the mtg-graph app, open the MTGA import dialog and choose the **Live scan** source.

The local bridge listens on `http://127.0.0.1:17171`; the app talks to it directly, so no file is exported or uploaded.

You don't have to type a card to anchor the scan: in the app's Live scan, choose
"Paste a deck" and paste any deck you own (Arena → deck → Export). The scanner uses
the deck's card counts to find your collection — usually no manual card entry needed.

## Files
- `MTGA_Exporter.exe`: The standalone application.
- `mtg.py`: The source code.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `install.bat`: Setup script for Python users.
